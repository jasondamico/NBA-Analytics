    "For each season that I plan on analyzing, over 400 players and their stats are available. However, only a select few of those players are even in the MVP conversation, and its rare to see any more than 5 players in pundet predictions for the MVP recipient at the end of the season. For that reason, the data can be significantly cleaned up of players irrelevant to the MVP conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's extremely difficult to quantify what makes a player in/out of the MVP conversation. Some general prerequisates for an MVP that would not be debated in NBA circles are as follows. Admittedly, these filters are conservative, but a large portion of the players in the data are removed by them. The candidate must:\n",

    "Another thing to note about filtering is that while it would be nice to filter down to only the \"real\" contenders (around 5 players for a given season), the players who *don't* receive votes are important data points as well (particularly in the context of training). Therefore, **my aim is to filter down to approximately 50 players for a given season**."

    "One incredibly helpful tool for analysis are a player's win shares.

The field \"is calculated using player, team and league-wide statistics and the sum of player win shares on a given team will be roughly equal to that teamâ€™s win total for the season\". While this datapoint has the potential to be arbitrary, the methodology at least provides a ballpark.\n",
