# NBA MVP Predictor Project

The NBA MVP Predictor Project is a data analytics project that uses past NBA MVP voting records and season average statistics to predict the MVP of the 2020-2021 NBA season. This project may be used to reference the way that I perform data analysis and build predictive models. **The project is presently in the early stages of exploratory data analysis.**

## Data sources
- Season average statistics: [balldontlie API](https://balldontlie.io)
- MVP voting records: [basketball-reference.com](https://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/mvp.html)

## Usage

This project may be run to predict the most likely NBA MVP for the 2020-2021 NBA season based on the most recent season statistics available (the balldontlie API updates approximately every 10 minutes). This project may be accessed for NBA fans looking to see who's leading the MVP race or as a basic example project for aspiring data scientists to use as a reference.

## Motivation

The repository was created in December 2020 out of a desire to further hone my skills in pandas, scikit-learn and Jupyter. The project was initially a demo that I wrote to test my Rest API skills by exploring the balldontlie API, which I scaled to download CSV files of the data returned by the API to use for analysis. 

## Contributing

I welcome any contributions to this project! Please feel free to open an issue or create a pull request. If you have any suggestions for features to use in analysis, please open a pull request indicating such, and I will happily discuss the proposed feature further.
